# Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL and Power BI

This project analyzes healthcare data to gain insights into the distribution of hospitals, doctors, patients, and specializations across different regions in the US. The analysis is done using SQL and Power BI, and the results are presented in a dashboard.

## Business Questions

The following business questions are answered in this project:

1. The total number of hospitals, doctors, patients, and specializations.
2. Which regions of the US have a higher concentration of doctors according to the data?
3. Is there a relationship between doctors' rating and experience, and their availability?
4. What is the most common time for patients to visit a hospital?

## Data

The data utilized for this project was obtained from https://data.cms.gov/, which offers relevant healthcare datasets that were carefully chosen to meet the project's objectives.

## Analysis

The project includes the following stages of analysis:

1. Data Understanding - PostgreSQL is used to create tables and import data. SQL queries are utilized to identify duplicates, missing values, and the overall size of the data.
2. Feature Engineering - New features are created to enrich the dataset and improve analysis. In this project, a new feature named 'Region' is created to identify the location of hospitals, doctors, and patients across the United States.
3. Answering the Business Questions - SQL and Power BI are used to answer the business questions.
4. Creating the Dashboards - Power BI is used to create the dashboard.

## Dashboard

The dashboard includes two pages. The first page presents a summary of doctors' information, while the second page provides patients' information. The background design was created using Power Point, and filters and buttons were incorporated to facilitate navigation between the pages.

## Conclusion and Future Steps

This project utilizes SQL and Power BI to answer key business questions related to healthcare data. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to optimize healthcare resource allocation and improve patient outcomes. One potential future step is to develop a system that enables patients to identify hospitals with greater doctor availability during their preferred time.
